Skills:
ATHLETICS
ATHLETICS is a broad Skill, covering most of the physical activities
that a hero might undertake while adventuring, including
running, leaping, climbing, and swimming. Heroes with
high ATHLETICS Skill scores exhibit a winning combination
of physical prowess, grace, and control, generally gained
through continuous exercise and daily exertion.
A successful ATHLETICS roll produces a satisfactory outcome
in the physical activity, while a failed roll might lead to
serious harm, depending on the circumstances. A superior
result suggests a spectacular achievement.
Poor Mr Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but
they hoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that
grew right out into the path, and up he had to go as best he could.
AWARENESS
The AWARENESS Skill represents a hero’s readiness to react
and the ability to notice something unexpected, out of the
ordinary, or difficult to detect. A high Skill score reflects both
keen senses and the experience to understand what is seen or
heard — a high level of watchfulness is extremely useful if a
Player-hero
serves as a look-out
for the Company.
As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter
space between two trees, and then halt.
AWE
This Skill measures the capacity to evoke respect in onlookers,
and determines the impression the Player-heroes
make
on someone they meet for the first time. Depending on the
circumstances and on the player’s intentions, it can be used
to instil wonderment, admiration, or even fear. AWE arises
from a hero’s native charisma, but can also be engineered
by a dramatic entrance or impressive attire.
Successful use of the AWE Skill evokes the chosen effect,
while failure can lead to the opposite result. Achieving a superior
success means that a hero has won the hearts of the
onlookers or cowed them into silent submission.
For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame
flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown.
BATTLE
A rating in this Skill shows a firm grasp of the rules of battle
and the capability to maneuver appropriately when involved
in a violent confrontation. The BATTLE Skill can be used to
gain an advantage when fighting against a group of foes, or
leading a company of troops in open battle and maintaining
order in the midst of chaos (individual fighting talents are
covered by Combat Proficiencies on page 65).
“Fools!” laughed Bard, “to come thus beneath the Mountain’s arm!
They do not understand war above ground, whatever they may know
of battle in the mines.”
COURTESY
The Free Peoples recognise common norms of decency and
ancient conventions of behaviour. Observing these traditions
demonstrates respect and is a way of quickly establishing a
friendly footing even with complete strangers.
Succeeding in a COURTESY roll might mean the Player-heroes
know what to say at the right moment to make a good
impression with their host, or are mindful of their manners
when receiving guests.
“You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,” said the Dragon.
CRAFT
The CRAFT Skill doesn’t really cover the whole range of abilities
of smiths, wrights, and other artisans, but reflects a talent
for making or mending things by hand. CRAFT can be used to
repair the wheel of a cart, or construct an improvised raft with
wood found on a river shore, or to start a fire on a windy hill.
A high CRAFT score may indicate that the Player-hero
was
a craftsperson before starting a life of adventure. Some Cultures,
such as the Dwarves and Noldorin Elves, revere crafts
as the highest expression of creativity.
… the only craft little practised among them was shoe-making;
but
they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful
and comely things.
ENHEARTEN
Player-heroes
can use the ENHEARTEN Skill to instil positive
feelings in others, urging them to act on the matter at hand.
They achieve this mainly through example, charisma, and
personal conviction, rather than through the effective use
of words (which falls under PERSUADE). This Skill can be
used on individuals, but is particularly effective in influencing
crowds. Player-heroes
with high ENHEARTEN ratings can be
forceful orators, passionate agitators, and well-loved
leaders.
A successful ENHEARTEN roll awakens a chosen feeling in
the subject, as long as it is not in opposition to their current
mood. A superior success is enough to influence wholly disinterested
individuals, or turn rivals into supporters.
…he returned to the walls, and passed round all their circuit,
enheartening the men…
EXPLORE
Player-heroes
rely on the EXPLORE Skill when they move
through an unfamiliar area of the Wild. An EXPLORE roll
may be required during a journey to find out where the Company
is heading, or to get back on track after a detour; to cope
with adverse weather conditions or other natural hazards; to
create paths through the wilderness suitable for others to
follow; or to choose a suitable place to set up camp. A high
EXPLORE rating is an invaluable resource if a Player-hero
is
acting as a scout for the Company.
“We have found a dry cave,” they said, “not far round the next corner;
and ponies and all could get inside.”
HEALING
The knowledge of how to relieve pain and apply remedies to
restore health to the suffering is an ancient one, and treatments
differ from culture to culture. However, almost all
traditions agree on the treatment of serious injuries, which
must be tended immediately to keep from worsening.
The HEALING Skill includes bone setting and the use of
herbs or salves, but the outcome relies on the ability of the
healer to understand what ails the sufferer and determine
what should be done to help them.
As a matter of fact, Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains,
had once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from
an arrow-wound.
HUNTING
Knowing how to hunt is a fundamental skill, shared by most
cultures of Middle-earth.
A HUNTING roll may be required
when pursuing a creature through wild areas, or to follow
tracks and identify a quarry by its spoor. The HUNTING Skill
also covers preparing traps and the training and use of hunting
dogs or birds.
In wilder areas, hunters learn to apply their trade to more
dangerous quarries — such as Orcs, Spiders, or Wargs — or
else risk becoming the prey.
They dwelt most often by the edges of the woods, from which they
could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over the open lands
by moonlight or starlight…
INSIGHT
INSIGHT represents the ability to see beyond appearances
and to recognise the hidden thoughts and beliefs of people.
INSIGHT does not reveal if someone is lying, but the information
it yields can be used to draw useful conclusions about
people’s motives. Heroes with a high INSIGHT score are often
recognised as being sensible and discerning individuals, and
many may seek their counsel.
A successful INSIGHT roll provides the Player-heroes
with
a reliable, but partial, portrait of the person they are observing.
A superior success allows them to correctly guess additional
details about an individual’s state of mind. INSIGHT
tests may be rolled in opposition to an adversary trying to
sway or convince a Player-hero
of something.
“There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark
rooms behind them,” said Faramir. “But in this I judge that you
speak the truth.”
LORE
LORE expresses a love for learning: be it a fascination with
descriptions of distant lands or an interest in family genealogy.
Whenever an action involves knowledge of some kind,
a LORE test is required.
Player-heroes
are considered to be knowledgeable in the
traditions of their own people, and so the Loremaster
should rarely require a player to make a LORE roll for information
regarding their own character’s Culture or the area they originally
came from.
He knew many histories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men
and the good and evil deeds of the Elder Days.
PERSUADE
This Skill allows the Player-heroes
to apply their reasoning to
convince other individuals of an idea or course of action. It
can be used to influence small groups of listeners, but only if
used in an appropriate context, such as a common hall. Persuasion
requires more time than other Personality Skills, but
can have a more lasting impact on other characters’ actions.
A high PERSUADE score denotes an uncommon eloquence, a
love of speech and knowledge of its proper use and its effect
on listeners. Wise people, advisers to chieftains and kings, and
their messengers all share this passion for the spoken word.
The successful use of the PERSUADE Skill allows a Player-hero
to convince an audience that their current position
regarding a matter is flawed. A superior success convinces
listeners of the quality of a hero’s stance, and may even turn
them into ardent believers.
Aragorn laughed. “Every man has something too dear to trust to
another. But would you part an old man from his support? Come,
will you not let us enter?”
RIDDLE
Owing its name to the ancient game, the RIDDLE Skill represents
the ability to draw conclusions from seemingly unconnected
scraps of information by deduction, reasoning, and
intuition. Adventurers also rely on RIDDLE whenever they are
forced to talk about a subject but prefer to conceal part of
what they know; for example, to tell something about themselves
without revealing their identity.
As an accepted custom among many cultures, speaking
in riddles is usually allowed among strangers meeting for the
first time and wanting to speak guardedly. This Skill is also
used to gain helpful insight from a spoken or written riddle.
“A Hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I cannot say how
long ago.” “How then do you read this riddle?” asked Gimli.
SCAN
Player-heroes
can use the SCAN Skill when examining something
closely or attentively. This Skill allows a Player-hero
to
skim through a book to locate a piece of relevant information,
look for concealed doors or hidden inscriptions, recognise a
familiar face in a crowd, or locate a set of tracks on the ground.
SCAN rolls are generally initiated by the players rather than
the Loremaster.
One roll is required for each inspection of
a small area, such as a room. AWARENESS, rather than SCAN,
is used to see if a hero passively notices something.
A successful SCAN roll generally lets Player-heroes
find
what they are looking for — if it is to be found at all. A superior
success usually means the object is found more quickly.
“Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and
grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls
and books.”

SONG
Hobbits and Men, Elves and Dwarves, even Goblins and
maybe Orcs: all creatures of Middle-earth
celebrate by playing
music and singing songs. Great deeds and grim misfortunes
are remembered in verse, and pleasant or comic stories are
told to ease spirits and find comfort.
The SONG Skill is used to recite poems, sing songs,
or play instruments suitable to a character’s Culture. It
can also be used to learn new works or create original
compositions.
As they sang, the Hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by
hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce
and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of Dwarves.
STEALTH
Player-heroes
resort to STEALTH whenever they need to act
in a furtive or secret way. The Skill includes hiding, moving
quietly, and shadowing others. These activities often rely on
quickness and precision, so a stealthy Player-hero
combines
practised caution with the ability to judge the right moment
to take a chance. Hunters, burglars, and solitary fighters use
STEALTH to prosper in their trade.
A successful STEALTH roll indicates that the hero has gone
unnoticed, while failure almost certainly attracts unwanted
attention. A superior success produces an outcome so flawless
that it may even be impossible to notice the deed after the fact.
So silent was his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly
have surpassed it, and he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself
as he drew near the lower door.
TRAVEL
In the Third Age, the cities, villages, and towns of Middle-earth
are often separated by many leagues of wild or deserted
areas. Roads that used to lead safely to distant realms now end
in broken trails that go nowhere. Whichever way the Company
chooses to go, it will be a long and weary way before
they get there.
A successful roll of TRAVEL may let a Player-hero
estimate
the length of a journey, read a map, and even evaluate
whether a group of strangers on the road can be approached
safely or if they should be left alone instead. A good TRAVEL
Skill is an invaluable asset for the Guide of the Company
when on a journey (see page 108).
The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green
vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range,
and their going would be slow…
