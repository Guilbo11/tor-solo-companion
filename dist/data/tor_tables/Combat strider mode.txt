Combat strider mode

COMBAT
In Strider Mode, rather than facing foes shoulder-to-
shoulder
with your Company, you must stand alone against the enemy.
Strider Mode offers some tools for the solo Player-hero,
including a new stance to give lone, bow-wielding
Player-heroes
a fighting chance.
SKIRMISH STANCE
Combat in Strider Mode operates much the same as in
The One Ring core rules, with a number of opening volleys
(depending on the distance between combatants) preceding
close combat.
But for Player-heroes
who prefer bows and thrown weapons,
the Skirmish stance allows a solo Player-hero
to fight “on
the move,” exchanging ranged attacks while seeking advantageous
positions from which to strike.
SKIRMISH STANCE (RANGED COMBAT)
You fight on the move, navigating the terrain and exchanging
volleys with pursuing or fleeing foes.
♦ You can only attack your adversaries using ranged
weapons. Adversaries that attack you with melee weapons
lose (1d), while those who attack you with ranged
weapons suffer no penalty.
♦ For ranged attack rolls, you lose (1d).
♦ To escape from combat, roll for your ranged attack
(without losing (1d) on the roll). If you succeed, you
do not inflict any damage but instead leave the battlefield
— otherwise you remain engaged.
♦ Combat Task: Gain Ground
GAIN GROUND — SKIRMISH STANCE
Combatants on the move can attempt to gain an advantageous
position against their foes, ambushing enemies or firing from
an overlook. To do so, the acting player makes an ATHLETICS
or SCAN roll as the main action for the round.
On a successful roll, the attacker gains (1d) on their next
ranged attack, plus another (1d) for each Success icon
rolled. These bonus dice can be used on a ranged attack
roll to escape from combat (see Skirmish Stance).
COMPLICATIONS AND ADVANTAGES
Without a Loremaster,
the solo player must decide whether
their Player-hero
and any adversaries fight with complications
or advantages.
Sometimes it’s clear based on the environment and the
circumstances of the battle — the Player-hero
fights in knee-deep
water or unleashes arrows over a great distance. Rolling
a rune or icon can also serve as a trigger for a
complication or advantage to make a fight more complex
and interesting.
ADVERSARY ACTIONS
In Strider Mode, the solo player finds themselves in the
unique position of controlling both their Player-hero
and
the adversaries in their path.
In combat, an adversary uses the weapon best suited to
the situation, depending on the stance of the Player-hero.
If
multiple weapons apply, the adversary uses the one which
gives them the biggest advantage or greatest chance of dealing
damage.
SPECIAL DAMAGE
When spending icons to trigger special damage from an
adversary, use the Heavy Blow special damage result unless
the adversary lists a special damage option in its stat block.
FELL ABILITIES
If using an adversary’s Fell Ability would give them a clear
advantage in combat, they use it, spending any Resolve/Hate
required. If the ability would come at a cost or pose a risk
to the adversary or their allies, you can ask the Telling Table
(page 10) to determine the enemy’s behaviour.
