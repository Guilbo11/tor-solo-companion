Councils strider mode

COUNCILS
Councils involve your Player-hero
standing before important
figures in a formal setting. They represent social events of
considerable import, often involving discussion of vital events
or tense negotiations.
Councils for a lone Player-hero
are resolved as described
in The One Ring core rulebook (page 104), with some further
guidelines detailed below.
SETTING RESISTANCE
As with The One Ring core rules, you begin a council by setting
the resistance, based on your Player-hero’s
intended goal in
the interaction — 3 for a reasonable request, 6 for a bold
request, or 9 for an outrageous request.
If you’re not sure what resistance your goal entails, choose
two of the options, make one of them likely, and roll on the
Telling Table (page 10) to see if the answer is “yes” for the
likely option. If not, it is the other.
ROLEPLAYING INTERACTIONS
As a solo player, it might feel strange or unintuitive to roleplay
with yourself. But it’s important that your councils do
not devolve into a series of dice rolls. Think through the discussions
happening — the different motivations at play, and
the disagreements that might arise.
When you have a specific question about a character’s
response during a Council, you can ask the Telling Table
(page 10) for a “yes” or “no” response. If you have a more
general question about the nature of a topic or response, use
the Lore Table (page 11) and envision what the answer
means in the context of the characters and conversation.
