THE EYE OF MORDOR
A lone Player-hero
draws less attention than a full Company,
but may still catch the Eye of the Enemy. Use the optional
Eye Awareness score as described on pages 169–171 of The
One Ring rulebook to track your visibility to the Enemy and
the actions of dark forces in Middle-earth.
Although these rules are optional, they are recommended
for use with Strider Mode as a means of making the campaign
more dynamic and reinforcing the Enemy and the minions
of Shadow as ever-present
and cunning threats.
START ING EYE AWARENESS
Calculate your starting Eye Awareness score as described on
page 170 of The One Ring core rulebook. Start with an Eye
Awareness of 0, and adjust as follows.
♦ Add 1 if you have a VALOUR rating of 4 or more
♦ Add 1 if you are a Dwarf
♦ Add 2 if you are an Elf or Dúnedain
♦ Add 3 if you are a High Elf
♦ Add 1 for each Famous Weapon and Armour you carry
INCREASING EYE AWARENESS
Use the guidelines detailed on pages 170–171 of The One Ring
core rulebook, as described below.
♦ Whenever a die roll made outside of combat produces
an icon, regardless of whether the roll resulted in
success or failure, raise Eye Awareness by 1 point
♦ Whenever the Player-hero
gains 1 more shadow points
outside of combat, increase the Eye Awareness level by
that amount
♦ Magical successes using a marvellous artefact or wondrous
item might increase Eye Awareness, as per the
guidelines on page 171 of The One Ring core rulebook.
Also, an result on the Ill-Fortune
Table (page 8) will
raise the Eye Awareness Score by 2. This is in addition to the
increase from the initial result which triggered a roll on
that table. The Eye is fixed upon you!
RESETTING EYE AWARENESS
The Eye Awareness score does not increase during a Fellowship
phase. At the beginning of the following Adventure
phase, reset the score to its starting value.
HUNT THRESHOLD
The Hunt threshold for a lone Player-hero
is the same as that
for a Company, as described on page 172 of The One Ring core
rulebook. Use the Region Table and Hunt Modifiers Table
to set the threshold.

MODIFIER DESCRIPTION
+4 The Player-hero
is protected by the blessing
of a Wizard, or another powerful character
+2 The Player-hero
is travelling under a false
name, treading paths that are seldom trodden,
or otherwise taking actions to be discreet
and unobtrusive
−2 The Player-hero
has gained great renown in
the area thanks to some exceptional deed
−4 The Enemy is actively looking for the Player-hero,
or their mission or goal is known to
them

REVELATION EPISODES
When your Eye Awareness matches or exceeds the current
Hunt threshold, you must face a Revelation Episode.
In Strider Mode, a Revelation Episode represents the
influence and actions of the Enemy or other sinister or hateful
powers.
To determine the nature of the episode, roll on the Revelation
Episode Table, choose a result from the table, or imagine
a threat which best represents the current situation. Some
episodes might create an immediate danger or complication
for your Player-hero.
Others trigger dire events in the world
which the Player-hero
is (for now) unaware of, but which will
cause future complications. If you set a Revelation Episode
in motion outside the perception of your Player-hero,
make
note of it and consider how it may later reveal itself.
Once you have triggered a Revelation Episode, reset your
Eye Awareness to its starting value.
