“…we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often
enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work
or even coal mining.”
The ability levels of all newly-created
Player-heroes
can now
be raised, to represent their experiences prior to their life
as adventurers.
Players have 10 points (15 in Strider Mode) to spend on raising Skills and
Combat Proficiencies. The cost of raising each ability
is shown in the two tables to the right. The first table
gives the costs for Skill levels, while the second shows
the costs for Combat Proficiency levels.
Players are free to raise their abilities as they see fit, as long as they
have enough points to buy the desired level. Players can also buy
ranks in Skills or Combat Proficiencies that their Player-heroes
didn’t possess at all, or buy multiple ranks in the same ability, as
long as they pay the cost of each level individually.

EXAMPLE:
A player wanting to go from LORE to LORE would
spend a total of 10 points (2 to raise the Skill from to ,
3 to go from to , and 5 to go from to ).
