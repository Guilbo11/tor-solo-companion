Patrons

YOUR PATRON
Perhaps the most important choice for a lone Player-hero
is
their Patron. A Patron can provide the motive for an errand
or quest, and help tether your Player-hero
to the larger world.
Introducing a Patron can serve as a great way to kick off a
campaign for a new character, and meeting with them during
the Fellowship Phase offers an opportunity to report on your
progress or accept a new task.
In choosing your Patron, pay close attention to their
Favoured Callings, as well as their Agenda — ensure both
support your intended goals with solo games. For Player-heroes
interested in undertaking missions against the Shadow,
Gandalf and Gilraen present enticing options. A Player-hero
seeking fame and lost relics might find Bilbo or Balin more
suitable.
PATRON QUESTS
In the following tables, each starting Patron is given a set of
quests fitting their agendas. Use these to help inspire the
nature of a Patron-given
quest as a starting adventure for your
character, or the next goal within a continuing campaign.
To select a quest from a Patron, pick one that interests you,
roll one 6-sided Success die for a random result, or accept
the missions in sequence starting with the first. Envision the
details of the task as revealed by the Patron, and consider the
open questions posed by each. If the quest involves travel,
identify the destination. If the destination is unknown to you
and the patron, consider what you must do to locate your
objective.
If you ask the Patron questions about the mission, you
can simply imagine their answer as appropriate to the nature
of the task, or use the Telling Table and Lore Table to help
inspire their response. Leave room for aspects of the quest
which are unknown to both you and your Patron.
