Starting reward and virtue

There are many things that may betray the true nature of
adventurers. It may be their weather-beaten
look, or the
grim determination that surfaces when they set themselves
to a difficult task. In game terms, nothing defines the stuff
heroes are made of better than their special abilities and
superior gear.
The growth in stature of a hero in terms of power and
renown is tracked in the game using two values — VALOUR
and WISDOM. Both ratings are ranked from 1 to 6, reflecting
the gradual transformation of a novice adventurer into
a veteran hero.
At the beginning of the game, the Player-heroes
have
yet to prove their worth, and start with a rating of 1
in both characteristics.
Among their various effects on gameplay, VALOUR and WISDOM
grant players special abilities: Abilities granted by gaining
a new rank in WISDOM are called Virtues, while those
gained by an increased rank in VALOUR are called Rewards.
♦ Virtues give the Player-heroes
access to the peculiar
abilities of their folk.
♦ Rewards are upgrades that enhance a hero’s war gear.
At the start of the game, all players get to choose 1 Virtue
and 1 Reward, selecting them among those listed in Chapter 5.
