BARDINGS

CULTURAL BLESSING — STOUT-HEARTED
Stories tell that the Bardings lived under the shadow of a
great Dragon for decades.
Your VALOUR rolls are Favoured.

STANDARD OF LIVING — PROSPEROUS
Thanks to its successful trading connections the city of Dale
prospers. Those among the Bardings who choose a life of
adventure are usually members of less affluent families —
yet, their wealth is still superior to that of most of the denizens
of Eriador.

LANGUAGES AND TYPICAL NAMES
All Bardings speak Dalish, a language that can be described
as a very old form of the Common Speech. As far as their
names are concerned, they are usually composed of one or
two elements (for example, Dag — Day, or Lif-stan
— Life
Stone). Like most Northmen, Bardings often name their children
after a renowned ancestor or relative, or choose a name
beginning with the same sound or sharing one element with
that of the father (whose name is often given with their first
name when introduced formally — for example, Lifstan, son
of Leiknir, or Ingrith, daughter of Ingolf).

Dwarves of
durin’s folk

CULTURAL BLESSING — REDOUBTABLE
Dwarves make light of burdens, especially when it comes to
wearing armour.
You halve the Load rating of any armour you’re wearing
(rounding fractions up), including helms (but not
shields).
Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings,
for
dwarves make light of burdens…

NAUGRIM
Dwarves are shorter than Men, but their work as miners and
smiths endows them with powerful arms and shoulders. Yet,
they still favour shorter weapons over longer ones.
Dwarven adventurers cannot use the following pieces
of war gear: great bow, great spear, and great shield.

STANDARD OF LIVING — PROSPEROUS
With the fabulous Dragon-hoard
of Erebor reclaimed and
their kingdom restored, the Dwarves are much richer today
than in the past.

LANGUAGES AND TYPICAL NAMES
All Dwarves speak the Common Tongue, but preserve a knowledge
of a secret Dwarvish language. They receive a true name
at birth that they do not reveal to members of other folks,
and adopt another name in the tradition of their neighbours.
This custom has been in use for so long that a number of
names have become traditionally associated with Dwarves,
and are used almost exclusively by them. Dwarves of renown
are sometimes given an honorific title, celebrating an exceptional
deed or distinctive quality (for example, Thorin Oakenshield
or Dáin Ironfoot).

Elves of Lindon

CULTURAL BLESSING — ELVEN-SKILL
By virtue of their birthright, Elves are capable of reaching
levels of finesse unattainable by mortals.
If you are not Miserable, you can spend 1 point of
Hope to achieve a Magical success on a roll when using
a Skill in which you possess at least one rank.
“Keen are the eyes of the Elves,” he said. “Nay! The riders are little
more than five leagues distant,” said Legolas.

THE LONG DEFEAT
The Elves find it hard to forget the taint of the Shadow once
it has left its mark on their spirit.
When it is time to remove accumulated Shadow during
the Fellowship
Phase, you can only remove a maximum
of 1 point (see Spiritual Recovery, page 119).

STANDARD OF LIVING — FRUGAL
The Fair Folk live in harmony with Middle-earth
and have little or
no use for those things that others consider precious. They lack
nothing, and craft beautiful things using the richest materials,
but they don’t profit from their wealth the way other folks do.

Hobbits of the shire

CULTURAL BLESSING — HOBBIT-SENSE
Hobbits have learned their place in the world a long time ago,
and they display a robust capacity for insight that many folks
mistake for lack of courage. No visions or wild fantasies can
tempt them, as they do not seek power or control over others.
Your WISDOM rolls are Favoured, and you gain (1d) on
all Shadow Tests made to resist the effects of Greed.
… they have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly
never heard or have forgotten long ago.

HALFLINGS
Due to their reduced size, Hobbits cannot use larger weapons
effectively. The weapons available to Hobbits are:
Axe, bow, club, cudgel, dagger, short sword, short spear,
spear. Additionally, Hobbits cannot use a great shield.

STANDARD OF LIVING — COMMON
Hobbits live in peace, their land is well-tilled
and their borders
protected, but theirs is an isolated island in the middle of a
desolate region, and trading is an uncommon occurrence.

LANGUAGES AND TYPICAL NAMES

of a few words and names of their own forgotten tongue.
Names are composed of a first name and a family name. First
names for men are usually simple and short, with women
being often given names of flowers or precious stones, but
among the older families a custom survives of giving more
heroic and high-sounding
names, whose origin can be traced
back to a time before the Shire.

Men of bree

CULTURAL BLESSING — BREE-BLOOD
Due to the position of their homeland, the Men of Bree enjoy
better relationships with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other
inhabitants of the world about them than is considered usual.
Each Man of Bree in the Company increases the
Fellowship
Rating by 1 point.
The Men of Bree were brown-haired,
broad, and rather short, cheerful
and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves…

STANDARD OF LIVING — COMMON
Bree-land
is not as wealthy as it once was, but these days the
inhabitants of the four villages are no more rustic than their
neighbours in the Shire, and no less well-off.

differ, of course).

Rangers
of the north

CULTURAL BLESSING — KINGS OF MEN
Some say that the lordship of the folk of Arnor is a thing of
the past. Yet, the Rangers of the North have inherited the
sinews of those Men who wrested the Ring from the burning
hand of Sauron.
Add 1 point to one Attribute of your choice.
They were fair of face and tall, and the span of their lives was thrice
that of the Men of Middle-earth.

ALLEGIANCE OF THE DÚNEDAIN
The Rangers are devoted to fighting Sauron and his minions
by an ancient tradition of war and strife. This obligation
makes it harder for them to put their spirit at ease even when
enjoying a respite from adventuring.
During the Fellowship
phase (not Yule) you recover a
maximum number of Hope points equal to half your
HEART score (rounding fractions up).

STANDARD OF LIVING — FRUGAL
Rangers rarely wear or carry anything whose worth cannot be
measured in a practical way. Their gear or garments are never
considered precious for the gleam of stone or gold, but for
their capability to endure long journeys and strenuous fights.

as it is handed down from generation to generation. They
retain an ancient tradition of naming their children using
that fair speech.
