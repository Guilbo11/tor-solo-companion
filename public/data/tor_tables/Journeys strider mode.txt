Journeys strider mode

JOURNEYS
In The One Ring, journeys are a key aspect of undertaking
quests and errands. For a solo Player-hero,
these journeys
offer an opportunity to explore Tolkien’s richly imagined
world, face uncertainties and danger, and put your abilities
to the test. The structure of journeys in The One Ring are
perfect for Strider Mode adventures, because they tend to
introduce encounters and obstacles organically, and offer a
clear objective for your character.
Journeys for a lone Player-hero
are resolved mostly as
described in The One Ring core rulebook (page 108), with a
few changes as detailed below. Player-heroes
also have access
to the Strider Distinctive Feature (page 5).
WHEN TO USE THE JOURNEY RULES
As described in The One Ring core rulebook (page 109), the
rules for journey resolution should be used when travelling
to a specific destination across dangerous lands. If there is
enough uncertainty or danger to warrant a skill test, but the
journey is not worthy of the full journey rules, you can see
how you fare with a TRAVEL roll. For mundane travel within
safe territory, or when returning home along the same path,
the fate of your journey can be resolved without any rolls.
SETTING OFF INTO THE UNKNOWN
When playing The One Ring as part of a Company with a Loremaster,
you would normally have limited knowledge of your
destination and what lies along your path. As a solo player,
you must balance the information needed to manage the
journey with the viewpoint of your character.
To resolve a journey and imagine the places and people
you encounter, use the tools The One Ring provides for Loremasters,
including maps, random tables, and region information.
In addition, you can rely on the Telling Table (page 10),
Lore Table (page 11), and other tables provided in this supplement
to help bridge the gap between your knowledge as a
character and that which a Loremaster
would normally provide.
If your Player-hero
is particularly well travelled and experienced,
there will be more overlap of the information needed
to manage the journey with your character’s knowledge. If
your Player-hero
is new to adventuring and unfamiliar with
the world beyond their home, you will rely on Loremaster
tools without letting that information impact decisions from
the perspective of your character.
JOURNEY ROLES
Journey roles are not used in Strider Mode. Instead, your
Player-hero
must tend to all aspects of travel; you will still roll
for journey events (see below), but those events are keyed
directly to skills instead of roles.

SOLO JOURNEY EVENTS
To resolve journey events for a lone Player-hero,
skip the
event’s target step (page 112 of The One Ring core rulebook).
Instead, you are always the target of the event, and the challenged
ability is determined by the event’s nature.
As described on page 113 of The One Ring core rulebook,
roll on the Journey Events Table to determine the event type.
Your current location affects this roll as follows:
♦ If it is within a Border Land, make a Favoured Feat die roll.
♦ If it is within a Wild Land, roll one Feat die.
♦ If it is within a Dark Land, make an Ill-favoured
Feat die roll.
The Journey Events table above is slightly modified from the
version in the core rules to put the focus on a lone Player-hero.
Once the event type is determined, choose one of the following
options to help envision the nature of the event and
the challenge or opportunity your character faces.
♦ Based on the result from the Solo Journey Events
Table, imagine an incident or opportunity in a way
that fits the current situation and surroundings. Then,
make a test using an appropriate skill: EXPLORE,
AWARENESS, or HUNTING. Check the Solo Journey
Events table for the consequences of this skill roll.
♦ Reveal the nature of the event using an Event Detail
Table (see below).
EVENT DETAIL
To help envision the nature of an event, use an Event Detail
table to expand on the information provided by the Solo Journey
Events Table.
First, select the appropriate table for the type of event,
and check your result by rolling one Success Die. To speed
things along, you can roll this Success Die alongside your
Feat Die when first rolling on the Solo Journey Events Table.
Take a moment to envision the nature of the incident or
opportunity using the Event Detail prompt. If you need more
information, you can use the Telling Table (page 10) or
Lore Table (page 11) to answer questions about the event.
Once you have imagined the event and your character’s
response, make the indicated skill roll. As described in the
standard journey rules, if the event takes place in a hex suggesting
a hard terrain, lose (1d) on this roll. If the event happens
along a road, gain (1d).
Finally, resolve the scene using the consequence and
Fatigue Points gained or lost as shown in each Event Detail
table.

NOTEWORT HY ENCOUNTERS
A Noteworthy Encounter result on an Event Detail table indicates
an event which should not be resolved with a single
skill roll. Instead, give this event additional focus by treating
it as an extended encounter or scene. This scene might
incorporate skill rolls, combat, a council, or a Skill Endeavour
as appropriate.
You can also choose to translate any of the detailed event
results into a Noteworthy Encounter instead of using a single
skill test. In this way, you give a specific challenge or opportunity
more focus if it is interesting to you or especially relevant
to your Player-hero
or their quests. Overcoming a significant
challenge as part of a Noteworthy Event can then provide
experience as a Player-hero
milestone (page 7).
RESOLVING EVENTS
FOR A NOTEWORT HY ENCOUNTER
For a noteworthy encounter which is not decided using a single
skill roll, you still need to determine the overall outcome
when applying the consequences for your journey event. To
do so, decide if the event was ultimately favourable for your
character.
♦ If you managed to overcome a challenge or had an
overall positive event, treat it as a successful skill roll.
♦ If you failed to overcome a challenge, or faced severe
hardship or complications, use the failed result.
MAKING JOURNEYS COME ALIVE
For a solo Player-hero,
there may be a tendency to move
through the journey sequence without giving focus to the
ongoing narrative. Avoid this by taking the time to plan your
navigation as your character would, with the limited information
available to them. Then, after each marching test
or event, imagine the details of the adventure. What is the
weather? What is the nature of the terrain and path? What
do you see or encounter? Where do you make camp and
how do those surroundings inspire you or put you on edge?
Use the maps, area descriptions, and tables provided in
The One Ring core rulebook and supplements to help reveal
the nature of your surroundings. If you have a specific question,
use the Telling Table (page 10). If you want inspiration
for the nature of an encounter or your surroundings, use the
Lore Table (page 11).
