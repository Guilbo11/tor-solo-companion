Fellowship Phase strider mode
The Fellowship Phase is a player-driven
segment of the game
where a Player-hero
visits a safe haven to reflect on their
adventures, rest and recover, and undertake personal projects.
The structure of the Fellowship Phase, as described on
pages 118–120 of The One Ring core rulebook, is unchanged
for solo players. You can set the duration and location of the
Fellowship Phase as appropriate to your current situation,
with a longer break for Yule approximately once every three
Fellowship Phases. You will perform updates to spend accumulated
Experience Points gained through milestones, and
select one or more Undertakings.
Take the time to imagine your Player-hero’s
interactions
and activities during the Fellowship Phase. For the solo adventurer,
this is a welcome opportunity to bask in the warm glow
of community before setting off alone once again into the
wilds. Much of what defines the story of your character is how
they relate to others, and what personal goals they pursue
with the comfort of safety and time.
SPIRITUAL RECOVERY
FOR SOLO PLAYER-HEROES
As detailed on page 119 of The One Ring core
rulebook, the Loremaster
would normally determine
the number of Shadow points to remove
during the Fellowship Phase. As a solo player,
you instead decide how many Shadow points to
remove based on how your actions have impacted
the fight against the encroaching Shadow.
♦ If your actions have at least marginally
interfered with the return of the Shadow,
recover 1 Shadow point;
♦ If your deeds have actively hindered or
damaged the Enemy, remove 2 Shadow
points;
♦ If you have committed feats that would
gain the attention of the Dark Lord himself,
or at least one of his major servants, remove
3 Shadow points
